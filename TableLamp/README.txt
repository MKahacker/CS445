Homework 3

This is a programming assignment to illustrate dependency inversion and to practice the paradigms we learned in class as related
to system design.

The main executable is in the main.java file. This is where all the executable code for the button and Table Lamp resides. 
In order to build the assignment and run it, you have to import it into eclipse or intellij as a Java application. Then all you 
have to do is navigate to the src/Main/main.java and run the file. The program should turn on the button by pushing down and 
then turn it off through the same function. The table lamp can take any button and will be turned off when switched off and
turned on when switched on.
